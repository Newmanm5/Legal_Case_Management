# LSBU Family Law Legal Clinic Form
This is the final version (14/01/2021) of a relatively simple, user-friendly Bootstrap legal clinic form with PHP and MySQL functionality, created by and for LSBU. A functional demo of the form can be found [here](https://lfhcases.000webhostapp.com/demo/www.lsbu.ac.uk/study/study-at-lsbu/our-schools/law-and-social-sciences/subjects/law/family-law-hub.php). If that link isn't so functional, try [this one](https://lfhcases.000webhostapp.com/demo/wireframe-demos/form/form.php). Demos of the dashboards can be found (admin view)[here](https://lfhcases.000webhostapp.com/demo/wireframe-demos/dashboards/dashboard-admin.php) and (student view)[here](https://lfhcases.000webhostapp.com/demo/wireframe-demos/dashboards/student-cases.php). Code snippets can be found in the [`embed-form`](https://github.com/Newmanm5/Legal_Case_Management/tree/final-patch/embed-form) and [`embed-dashboards`](https://github.com/Newmanm5/Legal_Case_Management/tree/final-patch/embed-dashboards) folders.

The email function is dependent on PHPMailer, which can be installed on the system wherever this is used, or uploaded to the site's includes/lib directories.
