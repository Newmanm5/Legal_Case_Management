# Legal-Clinic
An application form and database for free legal aid from LSBU. Version 2, started in late December by Akpeki, with little knowledge in Bootstrap or PHP. This version focuses more on visual appeal than functionality and splits the demo (what can be used in presentations and videos), from the embed (what can be used by other developers for modularity).
